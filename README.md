HyperCouch is (to be) a collection of CouchApps that enable various
Hypermedia APIs within an [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) database.

The goal is to provide *browse-able* alternate APIs for CouchDB.

## Hypermedia Application Language (HAL) - `application/hal+json`

Bradley Holt began a
[CouchDB Hypermedia API](https://github.com/bradley-holt/couchdb-hypermedia-api/)
project back in 2012 which worked on `collection` and `resource` documents.

The variant included here is based on that (New BSD licensed) code, but
includes a default collection which *is* the primary index of the current
database.
